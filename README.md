Twitter bot posting random oofs

An oof is an exclamation. Oofs can be happy, sad or anything in between.  

The oof bot uses a .txt file containing 1348 adjectives to describe an oof. 
A sentence such as "The humble oof." is posted every 30 minutes.

Words that have been used are not removed from the file, duplication may occur. This is so the bot can (in theory) run indefinitely.
New words can be added to the .txt file, the bot simply needs to be re-delopyed for changes to take effect.

This is just a fun method of experimentation with Twitter APIs and Python.
